### Projects:

- **Comus - delivery food - Vue.js, Laravel**
Implementation of a web application for online food ordering and purchasing, developed on both the front-end and back-end. I worked with a team to implement interactive features with JavaScript, engaging both users and restaurant owners. The platform offers a dedicated area for restaurant registration, order management, and dish editing. On the front-end, we optimized the homepage display and dish selection for a better user experience. There is an online payment system with credit card validation and sending confirmation emails to users and restaurateurs.

- **Project Manager - Laravel & MySQL on Vite** <br>
Implementation of a Portfolio site for displaying projects and related information using Laravel and MySQL. On the front-end side, we created a static layout with navbar, footer and a search field to filter projects, paginated according to a precise pattern. After locating the desired project, you can focus on the specific information and eventually return to the filtered projects area. On the back-end side, an administrative dashboard has been created for entering and editing information.

Implementation of a WhatsApp-like web application, with features for auto-reply, filtering and opening specific chats, and reading related conversations.
